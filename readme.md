# Future Distribution Systems Advanced Modeling

## Introduction

This repository contains the work for "Future Distribution Grids: A Case Study of Modeling the Magnetic Field, the Thermal Field and the Electrical Circuit Parameters in a Power Transformer" - a project developed in collaboration with TU Delft and STEDIN Rotterdam.

The project focuses on modeling power distribution transformers to address the challenges of modern electrical distribution grids. With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicle charging, these grids face new operational challenges including higher frequency harmonics that affect transformer performance and lifespan.

## Project Overview

The operation of electrical distribution grids is rapidly evolving due to:
- Integration of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels)
- New loading patterns from battery charging (e.g., electric vehicles)
- Introduction of higher frequency harmonics in the system

This project aims to develop comprehensive models for analyzing power transformers, focusing on:
1. Electromagnetic field analysis
2. Core loss estimation
3. Copper loss calculation
4. Thermal behavior modeling
5. Transformer aging/lifetime prediction

Our models help chart the amplitude, frequency content, and location of electromagnetic losses, which is essential for monitoring the life-time expectancy of assets in the distribution grid.

## Getting Started & Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Julia programming environment (version 1.6 or higher, tested with 1.10.9)
- Python with Jupyter Notebook support (for IJulia and PyPlot functionality)
- GMSH for mesh generation
- Paraview for visualization

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EzraCerpac/FutureDistributionSystemsAM.git
   cd FutureDistributionSystemsAM
   ```

2. Install Julia (version 1.6 or higher):
   - Download from: https://julialang.org/downloads/
   - Current codebase has been tested with Julia 1.10.9

3. Install required Julia packages using the Project.toml file:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

4. If you encounter any package compatibility issues during installation, try the following approaches:

   a) Resolve dependencies and reinstall:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   Pkg.resolve()
   Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

   b) Install packages in smaller groups:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   
   # Core scientific packages
   Pkg.add([
     "DifferentialEquations",
     "ModelingToolkit",
     "OrdinaryDiffEq",
     "LinearAlgebra",
     "SparseArrays"
   ])
   
   # Domain-specific packages
   Pkg.add([
     "DiffEqOperators",
     "DomainSets",
     "Ferrite",
     "Gridap",
     "Interpolations",
     "MethodOfLines"
   ])
   
   # Visualization and utilities
   Pkg.add([
     "Plots",
     "GR",
     "PyPlot",
     "PyCall",
     "IJulia",
     "Gmsh",
     "WriteVTK"
   ])
   ```

5. For visualization packages:
   
   a) Install GMSH:
   - Download from: https://gmsh.info/
   - Make sure it's available in your system PATH
   
   b) Install Paraview:
   - Download from: https://www.paraview.org/download/
   - Used for visualizing VTK files generated by the models

6. For Python-based functionality (PyCall, PyPlot, IJulia):
   
   a) Ensure you have Python installed with numpy, matplotlib, and jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```
   
   b) Configure PyCall to use your Python installation (if needed):
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   ENV["PYTHON"] = "path/to/your/python" # Optional: Set specific Python version
   Pkg.build("PyCall")
   ```

### Known Installation Issues and Solutions

- **Package Version Conflicts**: The codebase requires specific versions of several packages. If you encounter errors during `Pkg.instantiate()`, try installing packages individually as shown above.

- **GLMakie Precompilation Issues**: GLMakie may fail to precompile on some systems. This is often related to graphics drivers. If you encounter issues, try using Plots with a different backend:
  ```julia
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add("Plots")
  using Plots
  gr() # Use GR backend instead
  ```

- **Missing HarmonicBalance Package**: The original project referenced a package called `HarmonicBalance` which is not available in the standard Julia registry. This dependency has been removed from the current version. If you need this functionality, please contact the original authors.

- **Gridap Compatibility**: If you encounter issues with Gridap, try explicitly installing version 0.17.23:
  ```julia
  using Pkg
  Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="Gridap", version="0.17.23"))
  ```

## Key Components/Models

Our project consists of five interconnected sub-models:

1. **Magnetic Field-Circuit Coupled Model**: A 2D quasi-stationary electromagnetic field model coupled with an electrical circuit model for voltage-driven conductors.

2. **Core Loss Model**: Calculates ferromagnetic core losses due to eddy current effects.

3. **Copper Loss Model**: Computes losses in primary and secondary windings.

4. **Thermal Model**: A 3D temperature model that accounts for diffusion, convection, and energy conservation.

5. **Aging/Lifetime Model**: Predicts degradation of transformer components over time.

The implementation focuses on:
- Finite element modeling using Julia (Gridap, Ferrite)
- Parametric geometry generation with GMSH
- Time-harmonic and transient computations
- Linear and non-linear magnetic material properties
