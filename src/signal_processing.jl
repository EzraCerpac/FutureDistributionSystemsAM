"""
    perform_fft(time_signal::Vector{<:Real}, sampling_rate::Real)

Performs FFT on a real-valued time signal.

# Arguments
- `time_signal::Vector{<:Real}`: The input time signal (e.g., Az at a point over time).
- `sampling_rate::Real`: The rate at which the signal was sampled (samples per second, Hz).

# Returns
- `frequencies::Vector{Float64}`: Vector of frequencies for the FFT components.
- `fft_magnitudes::Vector{Float64}`: Vector of magnitudes of the FFT components (one-sided spectrum).
