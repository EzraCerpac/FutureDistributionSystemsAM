    " Solves the Poisson equation $- \\bigtriangleup u = f$ on the unit square domain $\\Omega=(0.,1.0)^2$ supplied with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition $u = 0$ on $\\Gamma$. The computational domain is kept simple on purpose for illustration purposes. The source function $f$ is defined as the sourcefct in what follows. Linear finite elements on triangular elements are used. The mesh is generated using the mesh generation software called gmsh (see [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info)). More information on the use of GMSH is provided at [extended-lab-sessions/gmsh](https://github.com/ziolai/finite_element_electrical_engineering/tree/main/extended-lab-sessions/gmsh)."

    "## Section 1: Geometry and Mesh Generation of Unit Square Geometry \n",
    "The code that follows performs <b>geometry generation</b> and <b>mesh generation</b> on the unit square geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "First the <b>geometry</b> is generated in the following five steps:\n",
    "1. four corner points of the square are defined. The points are labeled as 1 through 4;\n",
    "2. four lines are defined as the edges of the square are defined by connecting previously defined points. Edges are formed by connecting points pairwise. The lines are given a start and end point. The lines are thus oriented. The edges are labeled as 1 through 4;  \n",
    "3. the boundary of the square is defined by a loop connecting the four edges. The orientation of the edges given an orientation to the loop. The loop is oriented such that an imaginary observer walking on the loop finds the domain on his left-hand side. The loop is labeled as 1;  \n",
    "4. the surface of the square is defined by the loop. It is on this square that the mesh generation will take place. This square is labeled as 1; \n",
    "5. a name is given to the surface; \n",
    "\n",
    "Next the <b>mesh</b> on the geometry is defined by mesh generation. The mesh is generated by first meshing the four edges of the square. The mesh is subsequently propagated towards the interior of the square. The mesh density is controlled by the parameter lc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mesh is optionally written to file and visualized using the GUI. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercises </b>: \n",
    "1. change coordinate of one of the points and regenerate the mesh;\n",
    "2. change the mesh density by changing the value of the parameter lc and regenerate the mesh. Apply different mesh density on one or more point or edges of the square; \n",
    "3. extend the code to the generation of a mesh on a pentagon; \n",
    "4. extend the code to the generation of a mesh on an L-shaped domain; \n",
    "5. extend the code to the generation of a mesh on a square with an inner square removed thus practising the orientation of the loops; \n",
    "6. share imagines of the meshes obtained of social media of choice and notify your favorite finite element instructor; "
