    "## Section 1:/ Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of electrical distrubution grids is changing fast. The infeed of renewables and the loading by battery charging is causing unforeseen challenges. The finite element modeling of electrical power transformer is indispensable to chart the amplitude, frequency content and location of electromagnetic losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [master thesis text of Max van Dijk](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A15b25b42-e04b-4ff2-a187-773bc170f061?collection=education).   \n",

    "We consider the same three-phase power transformer considered earlier in the master thesis of Max van Dijk. (Need to include more specs here). \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to develop a model consisting of the following four components: \n",
    "1. a model in which the <b>magnetic field</b> is solved coupled with the <b>electrical circuit</b> for the currents in the windings. It is assumed that three-dimensional end effects can be neglected die to the lamination of the ferromagnetic core. A two-dimensional perpendicular current model for the magnetic field will therefore be solved. The magnetic field will be solved in terms of the perpendicular component of the vector potential as before in the course; \n",
    "2. a model for the estimation of the <b>iron losses</b> in the ferromagnetic core and the <b>copper losses</b> in the windings; \n",
    "3. a model for the <b>heat source</b> due to the transformer losses; \n",
    "4. a model for the <b>temperature</b> of the substation in which the transformer is housed; \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the introduction of new sources (e.g. solar panels) and loads (e.g. electrical vehicle charging) in the distribution grid which causes higher frequency harmonics. Of particular interest is the degradation of the thermal insulating properties of the transformer and the reduction of the life-time of the transformer over time due to higher harmonics.  \n",

    "Describe the mathematical model for the magnetic field computation. Formulate the magnetic field in terms of the $z$-component of the magnetic vector potential oriented perpendicular to the 2D modeling plane. Assume the field to vary harmonically at a single frequency. Formulate the boundary conditions. First assume the coils to be current driven, i.e., the applied current density over the cross-section of the coils to be given. Confirm that no electrical circuit equations are required. Next assume the coils to be voltage driven. Derive expression for the electrical circuit equation including the coupling with the magnetic field. Rewrite the strong form of equations into weak form. Derive expression to compute the magnetic flux and magnetic field from the $z$-component of the magnetic vector potential in post-processing stage of the FEM computations. Beware of:\n",
    "1. take saturation curve into account; high frequency will result in small skin-depth with large values of magnetic flux inside a small layer; without saturation curve, normB and losses are likely to be overestimated;  \n",
