    "## Section 1:/ Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of electrical distrubution grids is changing drastically. The infeed of renewables and the loading by battery charging is causing unforeseen challenges. The finite element modeling of electrical power transformer is indispensable to chart the amplitude, frequency content and location of electromagnetic losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [master thesis text of Max van Dijk](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A15b25b42-e04b-4ff2-a187-773bc170f061?collection=education).   \n",

    "We consider a three phase power transforer. (Need to include more specs here). \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to develop a model consisting of two components. The first conmponent is a 2D coupled magnetic field electrical circuit model for the magnetic field in the transformer. The second component is a 3D model for the temperature in the housing. (motivate this approach as we expect that 2D magnetic model is sufficiently accurate due to lamination of the ferromagnetic core).\n",
