    "## Section 1:/ Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of electrical distrubution grids is changing fast. The infeed of renewables and the loading by battery charging is causing unforeseen challenges. The finite element modeling of electrical power transformer is indispensable to chart the amplitude, frequency content and location of electromagnetic losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [master thesis text of Max van Dijk](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A15b25b42-e04b-4ff2-a187-773bc170f061?collection=education).   \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the same three-phase power transformer considered earlier in the master thesis of Max van Dijk. (Need to include more specs here). \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to develop a model consisting of the following four components: \n",
    "1. a model in which the <b>magnetic field</b> is solved coupled with the <b>electrical circuit</b> for the currents in the windings. It is assumed that three-dimensional end effects can be neglected die to the lamination of the ferromagnetic core. A two-dimensional perpendicular current model for the magnetic field will therefore be solved. The magnetic field will be solved in terms of the perpendicular component of the vector potential as before in the course; \n",
    "2. a model for the estimation of the <b>iron losses</b> in the ferromagnetic core and the <b>copper losses</b> in the windings; \n",
    "3. a model for the <b>heat source</b> due to the transformer losses; \n",
    "4. a model for the <b>temperature</b> of the substation in which the transformer is housed; \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the introduction of new sources (e.g. solar panels) and loads (e.g. electrical vehicle charging) in the distribution grid which causes higher frequency harmonics. Of particular interest is the degradation of the thermal insulating properties of the transformer and the reduction of the life-time of the transformer over time due to higher harmonics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## To do \n",
    "1. (D. Lahaye): revisit work by Gijs Lagerweij, in particular the implementation of the field-circuit coupled model and the treatment of the non-linearity for time-harmonic simulations (non-analytical residual, thus a fixed-point iteration is required); \n",
    "2. (D. Lahaye): insert slides by master students; \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2:/ Literature Study as a Start on the Assignment \n",
    "Consult references listed below to become familiar with the project. Rephrase asssignment with own words. Find estimates for the copper losses, iron losses and temperature in various operating conditions of the transformer. Check understanding of the assignment with D. Lahaye. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3:/ Two-Dimensional Coupled Magnetic Field Electrical Circuit Model    \n",
    "Magnetic field computations will be performed to estimate the copper and iron losses in the transformer under in various operating conditions (no load, short circuit, requires more text to describe these operating conditions). \n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure to what extend use Gridap, Ferrite or alternative as a reference for computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2D Magnetic Field Geometry Definition\n",
    "Use GMSH (or alternative) to construct a parametric 2D CAD model magnetic field for the power transformer. Beware of introduction of parameter $\\ell_z$ that describes length of the model in the $z$-direction. See [project by Gijs Lagerweij](https://github.com/gijswl/ee4375_fem_ta/tree/main/assignment2_fem2d).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2D Mesh Generation \n",
    "Construct computational mesh for above 2D CAD model. See [project by Gijs Lagerweij](https://github.com/gijswl/ee4375_fem_ta/tree/main/assignment2_fem2d). Beware of: \n",
    "1. structured mesh or boundary refinement to capture eddy current effects in the core;\n",
    "2. mesh the coil cross sections using rectangular elements and mesh remainder of geometry using triangular elements; \n",
    "\n",
    "Derive an expression for the skin-depth. Compute the skin-depth for various relevant parameter values. $\\delta = \\sqrt{1/(\\omega \\, \\sigma \\, \\mu)}$. High frequency will result in small skin-depth with large values of magnetic flux inside a small layer. Take this effect into account when generating the mesh (for both first and second order elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Requirements \n",
    "1. FE assembly on first order triangular elements rewritten (see work by Auke); \n",
    "2. FE assembly on second order triangular elements (see Assignments of Rahul and Savion). Ought to be written in style by Auke;\n",
    "3. FE assembly on first order quadrilateral elements (see Assignments of Rahul and Savion). Ought to be written in style by Auke;\n",
    "4. FE assembly on mixed triangular and quadrilateral elements both for first and second order elements;\n",
    "5. post-processing by integrating over surfaces (can/should this be done in paraview)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time-Harmonic Magnetic Field Electrical Circuit for the Magnetic Vector Potential Component A$_z$\n",
    "Describe the mathematical model for the magnetic field computation. Formulate the magnetic field in terms of the $z$-component of the magnetic vector potential oriented perpendicular to the 2D modeling plane (see previous work). Formulate the boundary conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single frequency, linear magnetic material, current driven coils\n",
    "Assume that \n",
    "1. the electromagnetic field varries harmonically at a single frequency (50 Hz); \n",
    "2. the ferromagnetic core is laminated; \n",
    "3. the ferromagnetic material behaves linearly (no magnetic saturation is taken into account); \n",
    "4. the coils are current driven, i.e., the applied current density over the cross-section of the coils is given. Confirm that no electrical circuit equations are required. The case of voltage driven coils will be different. See previous work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the lamination into account; lower the values for ferromagnetic material by some factor; this factor is hard to estimate; what is known in literature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewrite the strong form of equations into weak form. Perform finite element simulations of the magnetic vector potential. Derive expression to compute the magnetic flux and magnetic field from the $z$-component of the magnetic vector potential, the skin depth, the core losses and the ferromagnetic losses in post-processing stage of the FEM computations. Repeat computations for various operating conditions (no-load and short-circuit) of the transformer. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-linear magnetic material\n",
    "Next assume the ferromagnetic material to be non-linear. \n",
    "1. with lower values of the permeability $\\mu$ (due to saturation), the skin-depth is less pronounced and the peak values of normB are lower. We thus also expect lower value of the losses; \n",
    "2. results by Gijs Lagerweij show that the BH-curve (effective BH-curve, scaling with the RMS value) choosen by Max van Dijk in his thesis might not be the most appropriate ones. This requires further looking into; \n",
    "Repeat above computations. \n",
    "\n",

    "Next assume the coils to be voltage driven. Derive expression for the electrical circuit equation including the coupling with the magnetic field. Repeat above computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transient Magnetic Field Electrical Circuit for the Magnetic Vector Potential Component A$_z$\n",
    "Extend above (formulation and finite element computations) from time-harmonic formulation to transient computations (by time-stepping on the vector potential $A_z$ and the applied current). \n",
    "1. Assume current-driven windings and linear magnetic permeability. Perform time-stepping until effect of the initial conditions has disappeeared and a time-oscillating solution is obtained. Use DifferentialEquations.jl. Repeat for various parameter settings, e.g. settings for the electrical conductivity and frequency of the applied current density; \n",
    "2. post-process for the B-field, H-field, skin-depth (by plotting B-field along line perpendicular to the surface of the core), induced voltage (by surface integration over the volume), core loss, winding loss. Expect to see higher B-field peak values at higher frequencies due to the skin-effect;  \n",
    "3. extend from linear magnetic material to non-linear magnetic material (thus taking magnetic saturation into account). Perform FEM asssembly of the residual and the Jacobian (how to compute this Jacobian) at every time step. Expect to see lower B-field peak values as higher frequencies; \n",
    "4. extend from current-driven coils (ODE-formulation) to voltage-driven coils (DAE formulation); first assuming linear BH-curve (assembly prior to time-stepping loop); later assuming a non-linear BH-curve (assembly during time-stepping loop); \n",
    "\n",
    "### Compare time-harmonic and transient computations\n",
    "1. Transform time-harmonic results to time-domain by multiplying with the time-domain part of the solution of the solution;\n",
    "2. Transform time-domain to the frequency domain by Fast Fourier Transform? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 4:/ Two-Dimensional Copper and Iron Loss Model  \n",
    "1. estimate losses from literature or approximate models (loading guide).\n",
    "2. copper losses in the winding: [copper losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_loss); determined sperimentally using [short-circuit test](https://www.electricaleasy.com/2014/04/open-and-short-circuit-test-on-transformer.html); \n",

    "7. run simulation of short-circuit and open-circuit test for a set of increasing frequencies, post-process for skin depth in the ferromagnetic core along a vertical line, post-process for relative importance of coil and core losses; \n",

Given no information on largest temperature inside of domain and duration of this temperature. Properties of [transformer oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_oil).\n",

    "De BH curve in mijn model is vrij eenvoudig (gebaseerd op een eenvoudige formule), terwijl deze in werkelijkheid misschien anders is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verder zijn de Steinmetz parameters uit Max’ thesis naar mijn idee helemaal niet juist. Als we deze goed kunnen bepalen moet het mogelijk zijn een stuk dichter bij de gemeten verliezen te komen, zonder dat er complexe 3D modellen gemaakt hoeven te worden.\n",
    " \n",
    "Misschien het meest belangrijke, als we Gridap verder willen gebruiken, is de ontwikkeling van een betere interface voor de field-circuit coupling. Op dit moment is het door mijn implementatie namelijk niet mogelijk om gebruik te maken van sommige Gridap-onderdelen (zoals FEOperators), en daarmee wordt het modelleren van multi-field en transiente problemen een stuk lastiger. Dit zou bijvoorbeeld een extensie voor Gridap kunnen worden. De meeste code wordt op dit moment namelijk “verspild” aan de herhaaldelijke definitie van allerlei dingen in Gridap (integralen over de wikkelingen, voor de field-circuit coupling). Dit zou de code voor zowel TA1 als TA2 een stuk leesbaarder maken en fijner om mee te werken.\n",
