    "\n",
    "<b>Problem Formulation</b> Assume a 3D computational domain $\\vec{x} \\in \\Omega_m$ on which ${\\mathbf M} \\neq {\\mathbf 0}$. $\\Omega_m$ typically represents a metallic plate in an external magnetic field. We assume that no external current sources are present and that the magnetic material reacts accordinf to a linear magnetic material. In a continuous setting (i.e. prior to spatial discretization), the magnetic vector potential $\\vec{A}(\\vec{x})$ is a function of the magnetization vector $\\vec{M}(\\vec{x})$. A [Biot-Savart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotâ€“Savart_law) type relation yields that \n",
    "$$\\vec{A}(\\vec{x}) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\int_{\\Omega_m} \n",
    "                \\frac{\\vec{M}(\\vec{x}') \\times (\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}')}{\\|\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}'\\|^3} \\, d\\vec{x}' \\, = \\int_{\\Omega_m} \\vec{M}(\\vec{x}') \\times K(\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}') \\, d\\vec{x}' \\, , $$ where the kernel $K(\\vec{x}, \\vec{x}')$ is given by \n",
    "$$K(\\vec{x},\\vec{x}') = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi}  \n",
    "                \\frac{(\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}')}{\\|\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}'\\|^3} = \n",
    "                \\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\nabla \\frac{1}{\\|\\vec{x}-\\vec{x}'\\|} \\, . $$ \n",
    "Properties of $K(\\vec{x},\\vec{x}')$ are extensively studied in the literature. \n",
    "The magnetic flux $\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})$ (should this read $\\vec{B}_M(\\vec{x})$ instead) is then obtained via \n",
    "$$ \\vec{B}(\\vec{x}) = \\nabla \\times \\vec{A}(\\vec{x}) \\, . $$\n",
    "The magnetic field $\\vec{H}(\\vec{x})$ can be obtain as $\\mu \\, \\vec{B}(\\vec{x})$ in the ferromagnetic region and from $\\mu \\, \\vec{B}(\\vec{x}) + \\vec{M}(\\vec{x})$ in the magnetic region.  \n",
    "Thus something like (not entirely sure)\n",

    "         \n",
    "<b>Spatial Discretization</b> A mesh $\\Omega^h$ on $\\Omega$ with $N$ nodes is defined. The numerical approximation to vector $\\vec{M}(\\vec{x})$ is expressed as a linear combination on shape function (or basis functions) as (three components of $\\vec{M}^h(\\vec{x}$ expressed in the same linear nodal first order Lagrange basis functions, the summation upper therefore denoted by $3N$)\n",

    "Here we expand the three components of the vector $\\vec{M}(\\vec{x})$ in the same function basis. (notation changes in case that piecewise constant per element basis functions are used). \n",
    "Replacing $\\vec{M}(\\vec{x})$ by $\\vec{M}^h(\\vec{x})$ in the expression for $\\vec{A}(\\vec{x})$ yiels the numerical approximation $\\vec{A}^h(\\vec{x})$. Similarly, replacing $\\vec{A}(\\vec{x})$ by $\\vec{A}^h(\\vec{x})$ in the expression for $\\vec{B}(\\vec{x})$, yiels the numerical approximation $\\vec{B}^h(\\vec{x})$. Let $\\vec{m}$ denote the $3N$-vector of expansion coefficients of $\\vec{M}^h(\\vec{x})$ in the basis of $\\phi_i{(\\vec{x})}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ shape functions. Let $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ denote the $3N$-vectors obtained by point-matching the relationships that define them. Then clearly both $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are vector-valued functions with $3N$ components that map $\\vec{m}$ to $\\vec{a}(\\vec{m})$ and $\\vec{b}(\\vec{m})$, respectively. We can thus write formally that $\\vec{a}: \\vec{m} \\in R^{3N} \\rightarrow \\vec{a}(\\vec{m}) \\in R^{3N}$ and  \n",
    "$\\vec{b}: \\vec{m} \\in R^{3N} \\rightarrow \\vec{b}(\\vec{m}) \\in R^{3N}$. The Jacobian of mapping \n",
    "$\\partial b_i / \\partial m_j$ is the MoM matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Generation of the MoM matrix</b> We wish to develop a procedure that compute this Jacobian by going through the following three steps: \n",
    "1. apply (adaptive) quadrature (including handling of singular integrals) to compute the mapping $\\vec{a}(\\vec{m})$, i.e., a vector function of $3N$ components $a_i$ that each depend on the $3N$ vector $\\vec{a}$. The quadrature on $\\Omega$ is carried out element-wise;\n",
    "2. compute $\\vec{b} = \\nabla \\times \\vec{a}(\\vec{x})$  by applying automatic differentiation to differentiate wrt to $x$, $y$ and $z$\n",
    "3. apply automatic differentiation to differentiate (compute the Jacobian) the magnetic flux $\\vec{b}(\\vec{m}) = \\vec{b}(\\vec{a}(\\vec{m})))$ wrt to $\\vec{m}$ to obtain the MoM matrix;\n",

    "Solving of the linear system with the MoM matrix is considered outside of scope of this paper. "
