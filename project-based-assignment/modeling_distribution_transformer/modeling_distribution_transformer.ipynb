    "## Section 1:/ Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of electrical distrubution grids is changing fast. The infeed of renewables and the loading by battery charging is causing unforeseen challenges. The finite element modeling of electrical power transformer is indispensable to chart the amplitude, frequency content and location of electromagnetic losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see [master thesis text of Max van Dijk](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A15b25b42-e04b-4ff2-a187-773bc170f061?collection=education) and [previous assignments by Gijs Lageweij](https://github.com/gijswl/ee4375_fem_ta).   \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the same three-phase power transformer considered earlier in the master thesis of Max van Dijk. (Need to include more specs here). \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to develop a model consisting of the following four components: \n",
    "1. a model in which the <b>magnetic field</b> is solved coupled with the <b>electrical circuit</b> for the currents in the windings. It is assumed that three-dimensional end effects can be neglected die to the lamination of the ferromagnetic core. A two-dimensional perpendicular current model for the magnetic field will therefore be solved. The magnetic field will be solved in terms of the perpendicular component of the vector potential as before in the course; \n",
    "2. a model for the estimation of the <b>iron losses</b> in the ferromagnetic core and the <b>copper losses</b> in the windings; \n",
    "3. a model for the <b>heat source</b> due to the transformer losses; \n",
    "4. a model for the <b>temperature</b> of the substation in which the transformer is housed; \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the introduction of new sources (e.g. solar panels) and loads (e.g. electrical vehicle charging) in the distribution grid which causes higher frequency harmonics. Of particular interest is the degradation of the thermal insulating properties of the transformer and the reduction of the life-time of the transformer over time due to higher harmonics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## To do \n",
    "1. (D. Lahaye): revisit work by Gijs Lagerweij, in particular the implementation of the field-circuit coupled model and the treatment of the non-linearity for time-harmonic simulations; \n",
    "2. (D. Lahaye): insert slides by master students; \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2:/ Literature Study as a Start on the Assignment \n",
    "Consult references listed below to become familiar with the project. Rephrase asssignment with own words. Find estimates for the copper losses, iron losses and temperature in various operating conditions of the transformer. Check understanding of the assignment with D. Lahaye. \n",

    "## Section 3:/ Two-Dimensional Coupled Magnetic Field Electrical Circuit Model    \n",
    "Magnetic field computations will be performed to estimate the copper and iron losses in the transformer under in various operating conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the mathematical model for the magnetic field computation in terms of the $z$-component of the magnetic vector potential. This component is oriented perpendicular to the 2D modeling plane. This formulation is referred to as the perpendicular current formulation. Formulate the PDE in frequency (at single and multiple frequencies) and time domain, the boundary conditions and the initial conditions. Rewrite the strong form of equations into weak form. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ and magnetic permeability $\\mu = \\mu_0 \\, \\mu_r$ of the laminated core into account. What is the effect of the lamination on the value of $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$. Lowering these values? We will consider two models to represent $\\mu$. In the first model, $\\mu$ is consider to be constant. No magnetic saturation is not taken into account. In the second model, $\\mu$ changes with the strength of the magnetic field normB. The modeling of hysteresis is not taken into account. First use an analytical model for the non-linear material characteristic. Then use a BH-curved measured from data (with some form of spline interpolation between the data points). Compute derivative to arrive at a value for $\\mu$. Results by Gijs Lagerweij show that the BH-curve (effective BH-curve, scaling with the RMS value) choosen by Max van Dijk in his thesis might not be the most appropriate ones. This requires further looking into.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Derive an expression for the skin-depth and the value of the B-field and H-field in a thin layer close to the edge of the material. Compute the skin-depth for various relevant parameter values. $\\delta = \\sqrt{1/(\\omega \\, \\sigma \\, \\mu)}$. High frequency will result in small skin-depth with large values of magnetic flux inside a small layer. Take this effect into account when generating the mesh (for both first and second order elements).\n",

    "Misschien het meest belangrijke, als we Gridap verder willen gebruiken, is de ontwikkeling van een betere interface voor de field-circuit coupling. Op dit moment is het door mijn implementatie namelijk niet mogelijk om gebruik te maken van sommige Gridap-onderdelen (zoals FEOperators), en daarmee wordt het modelleren van multi-field en transiente problemen een stuk lastiger. Dit zou bijvoorbeeld een extensie voor Gridap kunnen worden. De meeste code wordt op dit moment namelijk “verspild” aan de herhaaldelijke definitie van allerlei dingen in Gridap (integralen over de wikkelingen, voor de field-circuit coupling). Dit zou de code voor zowel TA1 als TA2 een stuk leesbaarder maken en fijner om mee te werken.\n",
