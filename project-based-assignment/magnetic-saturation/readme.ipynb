We will try to adhere to the notation in which the index $i$ numbers the nodes and thus $1 \\leq i \\leq N+1$, in which $j$ numbers the (midpoints of the) elements and thus $1 \\leq j \\leq N$ and in which the index $k$ is a summation index (to be made more precise). \n",

We provide here an expression for normB on midpoint of element as function of the potential in the nodes. The computation of normB requires the derivative of the computed potential. To compute the derivative of the computed potential on the element $[x_j, x_{j+1}]$, we first interpolate between the nodal values and subsequently differentiate the linear interpolant. We thus assume normB to be a function $\\mathbf{normB}(\\mathbf{c})$ from $\\mathbf{c} \\in R^{N+1}$ to $\\mathbf{normB} \\in R^{N}$; specify the components of this mapping $normB_j(\\mathbf{c}) = \\sqrt{c_j^2 + c_{j+1}^2/h$.   \n",
