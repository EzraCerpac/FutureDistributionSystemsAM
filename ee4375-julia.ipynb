    "# EE4375 Usage of Julia \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides information on using [Julia](www.julialang.org) in the EE4375 course. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1: For Beginner \n",
    "\n",
    "### Books \n",
    "1. [ThinkJulia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html)\n",
    "2. [Julia Data Science](https://juliadatascience.io/)\n",
    "3. [Fundamentals of Numerical Computation](https://tobydriscoll.net/fnc-julia/frontmatter.html) by Driscoll and Braun\n",
    "\n",
    "### Videos series: \n",
    "1. [Introductory Video Series](www.youtube.com/@doggodotjl) \n",
    "2. Video tutorials listed at [julialang.org learning notebooks](https://julialang.org/learning/notebooks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: In General\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide list of pointers in a Jupiter notebook on the arguments that follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> single vs. multiple dynamic dispatch </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "See [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/); small example on [wiki on multiple dispath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch); video [The Unreasonable Effectedness of Multiple Dispatch‚Äù by Stefan Karpinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY); Section 4.1 of Fresh Approach paper; Chapter 17 of [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html); any other video, blog post can act as a refere; ask students to read through the documentation, give an example from documentation (ODE solvers on intervals for error bound propagation) and give own example; \n",
    "\n",
    "Need more information on the type system that Julia implements; type hierarchy; type stability of code; \n",
    "\n",
    "Is object orientation still an issue? What are ways to abstract data; see [Hands on design patterns and best practices with Julia](https://www.perlego.com/book/1365831/handson-design-patterns-and-best-practices-with-julia-proven-solutions-to-common-problems-in-software-design-for-julia-1x-pdf?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&campaignid=15913700346&adgroupid=133123169675&gclid=CjwKCAjwpqCZBhAbEiwAa7pXeYKebELCtsQ6SqNEzJ9OASEoO4lkr5P5QyjKIARICrnFYKq_QQ2yOBoCh14QAvD_BwE) by Tom Kwong. \n",

    "Application to FEM: Monte-Carlo sampling of FEM model with uncertain coefficients; \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> eager vs. lazy evaluation </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A lazily-evaluated list is a list whose elements are not evaluated when it's constructed, but rather when it is accessed.\n",
    "The benefit of lazy operations is that they can be materialized in-place, possible using simplifications. For example, allows to implement BLAS-1 in place operations. Allows allocation free population of vectors using heat, vcat and copy! \n",
    "Examples from https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl or https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl \n",

    "<b> function like objects and callable structs </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "See heading Function like objects in [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/); struct (data) with a method (function) associated to it; example of polynomial; ask students to read through the documentation, give an example from documentartion and give own example; \n",
    "\n",
    "Application to FEM: FEM assembly process; \n",
    "\n",

    "Refer to \n",
    "1. [gridap.jl](https://gridap.github.io/Gridap.jl/stable/) (functional approach); need to read its documentation at https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/pages/t013_poisson_dev_fe/ \n",
