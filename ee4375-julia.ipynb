    "## Section 2: Julia Programming Concepts Used in the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we discuss various Julia programming language constructions that will be valuable in the course.   \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> single vs. multiple dynamic dispatch </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a type language. Julia has type for e.g. integer, float ans string. Julia performs a dispatch on the type of a arguments in the function call. \n",
    "\n",
    "See [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/); small example on [wiki on multiple dispath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch); video [The Unreasonable Effectedness of Multiple Dispatch‚Äù by Stefan Karpinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY); Section 4.1 of Fresh Approach paper; Chapter 17 of [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html); any other video, blog post can act as a refere; ask students to read through the documentation, give an example from documentation (ODE solvers on intervals for error bound propagation) and give own example; \n",
    "\n",
    "Need more information on the type system that Julia implements; type hierarchy; type stability of code; \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> eager vs. lazy evaluation </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A lazily-evaluated list is a list whose elements are not evaluated when it's constructed, but rather when it is accessed.\n",
    "The benefit of lazy operations is that they can be materialized in-place, possible using simplifications. For example, allows to implement BLAS-1 in place operations. Allows allocation free population of vectors using heat, vcat and copy! \n",
    "Examples from https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl or https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl \n",
    "\n",
    "Application to FEM: list of elementary matrices and vectors as lazy arrays; \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> function like objects and callable structs </b> \n",
    "\n",
    "See heading Function like objects in [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/); struct (data) with a method (function) associated to it; example of polynomial; ask students to read through the documentation, give an example from documentartion and give own example; \n",
    "\n",
    "Application to FEM: FEM assembly process; \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> automatic differentiation </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "See [zygote](https://fluxml.ai/Zygote.jl/latest/) and [enzyme](https://enzyme.mit.edu/julia/); \n",
    "\n",
    "Application to FEM: modeling magnetic saturation (non-linear BH curve, non-linear constitutive equation). Non-linear assembly. Non-linar solve. (see examples of non-linear solve in e.g. Gridap.jl and Ferrite.jl)  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Parallel and GPU computing</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using macro @parallel and SharedArray. See e.g. Section 5.4 of Fresh Approach paper. \n",
    " \n",
    "Application to FEM: (1/2): parallel assembly and solve of the FEM matrix and right-hand vector by a parallel loop over the elements. Distribution of the elements over the processors. Use of parallel distributed matrices and vectors (layout of submatrices and subvectors connected by interfaces). (2/2) Parallel solve using iterative solution methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 3: Julia Packages for FEM\n",
    "See [gijswl/ee4375_fem_ta/tree/main/general/julia](https://github.com/gijswl/ee4375_fem_ta/tree/main/general/julia); (Domenico needs to reread)\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to \n",
    "1. [gridap.jl](https://gridap.github.io/Gridap.jl/stable/) (functional approach); need to read its documentation at https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/dev/pages/t013_poisson_dev_fe/ \n",
    "2. [ferritefem.jl](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/stable/) (classical approach); \n",
    "3. [minfem.jl](https://github.com/MinFEM/MinFEM.jl) (good for didactical purpose); \n",
    "4. [EndoBeams.jl](https://gitlab.emse.fr/pierrat/EndoBeams.jl) and [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965997822000849) (good for explanation on how to use structarrays.jl)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 4: Post Processing \n",
    "To visualize mesh and computed results, use either \n",
    "1. use Makie.jl (preferred); \n",
    "2. WriteVTK.jl and visualize results using Paraview; "
