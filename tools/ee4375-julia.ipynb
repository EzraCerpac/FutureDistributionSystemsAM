    "### Multiple Dispatch \n",
    "\n",
    "A key concept in the design and performance of Julia is the concept of multiple dispatch. In our discussion we will follow examples and ideas from the inspiring video [The Unreasonable Effectedness of Multiple Dispatch‚Äù by Stefan Karpinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY) (this video also provides a good introduction into abstract type, subtype definition, generic code and generic types). Other examples are given in [Chapter 17 of Thinking Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap17) and [Section 4 of Julia: A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607). More information on how multiple dispatch works in Julia is provided in [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/). More background information on multiple dispatch is provided in the [wiki on multiple dispath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch). \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The type system in Julia </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a typed language. This implies that Julia implements various types to store e.g. integers, floats and strings. The function <i>typeof</i> returns the type of a variable. Julia implements a hierarchy (in the form of tree structure) of types. The functions <i>subtypes</i> (with final-s) and <i>supertype</i> (without final-s) return the various sub (or derived) types and the super (or parent) type of a given type. The type hierarchy allows to implement multiple dispatch (binding a function to its most specific type of input). This feature is a key feature in the performance of Julia for scientific computing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> User Defined Types </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia allows the user to defined its own type. A container with elementary data types is build. This allows to register a person in a database with name, adres and phone number. More mathematicallly, a point can be coded with its spatial coordinates, a triangle with its edges and a finite element mesh with its elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code example that follows, first an abstract data type Pet is defined. Next, the two subtypes Dog and Cat are defined as a struct with a field Name. Next, the variable rex of type Dog and the variables whiskers of type Cat are defined. One can verify here the functioning of the functions <i>subtypes</i>, <i>supertype</i> and <i>typeof</i>. "
