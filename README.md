# Finite Element Methods for Electrical Engineering Applications (EE4375)

# Section 1:/ Introduction

This course consists of three blocks. 

### First Block 
In the first block we discuss the finite difference method to solve the Poisson equation in one and two spatial dimensions. We restrict ourselves to the interval and the square discretized by a uniform mesh. The Poisson equation models a diffusion process and typically appears in the computation of electrostatic and magneto-static fields. Our motivation is to introduce initial problem formulations and simplified numerical solution methods. 

### Second Block 
In the second block we discuss the variational formulation of the Poisson equation in one spatial dimension. This variational formulation allows to subsequently solve the problem by a finite element method using non-uniform meshes. We show that the versatility of the finite element method in solving problems that are more complex than in the first block. 

### Third Block 
In the third and last block we discuss the finite element solution of the Poisson equation in two spatial dimension. We discuss the mesh generation using triangle and the construction of the discrete problem using a loop over all elements. We illustrate the method in the computation of magnetostatic fields in transformers and electrical machines.  

### Assessment 
Each block will be concluded with a graded homework assignment. The three homework assignments have to be defended during the oral exam. 

### Learning Activities 
The course consists of two hours of lectures and four hours of computer lab sessions each week. We will use the programing language julia (see julialang.org) and Jupiter notebooks to develop the assignments. We will use the gmsh mesh generation software. You are kindly requested to install Julia, the Jupiter notebook system and the Julia interface to gmsh (Gmsh.jl) on your laptop. You are most welcome to give a look at the references below.

### More pointers/exercises/support for Julia in general, Julia for FEM specifically and GMSH  

#### Julia in General 
Provide list of pointers in a Jupiter notebook on the arguments that follow: 

<b> single vs. multiple dispatch </b>

See [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/); small example on [wiki on multiple dispath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch); video [The Unreasonable Effectedness of Multiple Dispatch‚Äù by Stefan Karpinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY); any other video, blog post can act as a refere; ask students to read through the documentation, give an example from documentartion and give own example; 

<b> eager vs. lazy evaluation </b>

A lazily-evaluated list is a list whose elements are not evaluated when it's constructed, but rather when it is accessed.
The benefit of lazy operations is that they can be materialized in-place, possible using simplifications. For example, allows to implement BLAS-1 in place operations. Allows allocation free population of vectors using heat, vcat and copy! 
Examples from https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl or https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl 

<b> function like objects and callable structs </b> 

See heading Function like objects in [section Methods in the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/); struct (data) with a method (function) associated to it; example of polynomial; ask students to read through the documentation, give an example from documentartion and give own example; 

<b> automatic differentiation </b>
